<hr>

<h3>Transformers: Rise of the beasts (2023)</h3>
<p>The graphic was sleek, the movements, voice of optimus, introduction of two new characters, plot twist and emotional purgation was incredible</p>

<h3>Sisu (2023)</h3>
<p>The setting was world war 2 and Sisu was magnificent in the way he bore pain, the way he didn't talk much, his fighting skills were awesome.</p>

<h3>Fubar Season 1 (2023)</h3>
<p>Arnold schwazenneger acted in this comical serie and he was amazing, actionpacked and smooth progression</p>

<h3>Brotherhood (2023)</h3>
<p>This is an interesting Nollywood movie that got my attention, Nice plot, action and effects at the combat scenes</p>

<h3>Extraction 1&2 (2020-2023)</h3>
<p>Both parts have two different plots, but the actions are really mind blowing. Chris hemsworth is really an outstanding actor.</p>
